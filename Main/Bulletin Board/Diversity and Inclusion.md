Why we added fields for biological sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression to our system
Diversity is an essential characteristic of the human experience. In our system, we are committed to promoting inclusion and respecting the individuality of each person. We recently implemented new fields in our forms to include information related to biological sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. In this article, we explain the reasons for this decision and its relevance for a more just and representative society.

Recognizing the complexity of the human experience
Traditionally, many systems limit the registration of people to just two fields: “male” and “female”, often confusing biological sex with gender identity. However, this approach does not encompass the full richness and plurality of human experiences. When updating our system, we opted for a structure that clearly differentiates:

Biological sex: refers to the physical characteristics with which the person was born.

Gender identity: refers to how the person identifies internally.

Gender expression: this is related to the way a person expresses their gender through behavior, clothing, appearance, etc.

Sexual orientation: defines who a person feels emotional and/or sexual attraction to.

These distinctions are essential to ensure respect, visibility and adequate care for all people.

Why this is important in our system
Our system was designed to handle sensitive data, especially in contexts such as health, education, psychological care or social services. By collecting this information in an ethical and secure manner, we are able to:

Provide more humanized and individualized care.

Avoid assumptions or approaches based on stereotypes.

Ensure the representation of different identities and orientations.

Contribute to more inclusive research, statistics and public policies (when authorized by the user).

Create a welcoming digital environment, where everyone feels seen and respected.

Commitment to ethics and privacy
We are aware of the sensitivity of this information. Therefore, we have implemented these features with a strong ethical commitment and strict privacy policies. All data is stored securely, with restricted access and only with the user's consent.

Diversity and inclusion as core values
Inclusion is not just a trend or a competitive advantage: it is a necessity. In a society that is increasingly aware and demanding of human rights, companies and systems that promote diversity stand out for their commitment to equity and the dignity of all people.

By making room for different identities, we are saying: you are welcome here, just the way you are.
