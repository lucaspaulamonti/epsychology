# Why Ubuntu?
You should consider Ubuntu Server as the operating system for your server for a number of technical, practical and even strategic reasons.

### Stability and Reliability
- It is widely used on servers around the world, including in clouds such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
- It offers long-term support (LTS) — versions with 5 years of security and maintenance updates, ideal for production environments.

### Lightweight and Performance
- Ubuntu Server does not have a graphical interface, which means it consumes fewer resources (RAM, CPU), leaving more power available for the services you are going to host (such as databases, APIs, etc.).

### Community and Support
- One of the Linux distributions with the largest active community.
- It is easy to find tutorials, forums and solutions for almost any problem.
- Canonical, the company responsible, also offers professional support, if necessary.

### Ease of Use
- Compared to other distributions (such as CentOS or Arch), Ubuntu Server is relatively user-friendly.
- It uses APT for package management, which is simple and robust.

### Compatibility and Updates
- It is widely compatible with modern technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Nginx, etc.
- Easy support for virtualization (KVM, LXD) and automation with Ansible, Puppet, etc.

### Security
- Frequent and automatic security updates (if configured).
- AppArmor support, firewall via ufw, SSH by default, and native best practices for production environments.

Ubuntu's Debian-based architecture helps a lot with stability and security — and it scales well as the system grows.
