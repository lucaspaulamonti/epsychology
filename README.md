<h1>epsychology</h1>

<p align="justify">
This course completion work focuses on the development and implementation of an electronic psychological record, called epsychology (epsy), intended for the Psychology and Nutrition School Clinic in the city of Araçatuba, São Paulo. The project is aligned with the Health and Wellbeing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), aiming to provide a safe and efficient electronic system for storing and managing psychological records.
</p>

## Objectives:

<p align="justify">
<b>1. Implementation of a local electronic system:</b> Provide a safe and reliable method for storing and accessing psychological records, allowing clinic professionals to access patient data in a quick, easy and organized way. This aims to optimize service time and improve the quality of services provided.
</br> <b>2. Digitization of existing medical records:</b> Convert paper medical records to a digital format, ensuring the preservation and accessibility of information about patients' history, which facilitates consultation and monitoring of treatments.
</br> <b>3. Standardization of medical record formatting:</b> Adopt a single medical record model that facilitates reading and interpretation of information, in addition to promoting the standardization of patient registration and monitoring procedures.
</br> <b>4. Compliance with security and privacy standards:</b> Ensure that the system complies with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), ensuring the protection of patients' sensitive information.
</p>

## Methodologies:

</br> <b>• User Training:</b> Training clinic professionals to use the system.
</br> <b>• System Implementation:</b> Installation and configuration of the system at the Psychology and Nutrition School Clinic.
</br> <b>• Digitization and Insertion into the System:</b> Digitization of physical records and insertion of information into the electronic system.
</p>

## Results (expected):

<p align="justify">
The implementation of the "epsy" electronic system should result in a significant improvement in the efficiency of patient care at the Psychology and Nutrition School Clinic. With digitally accessible medical records, professionals will be able to quickly access patient history, speeding up the consultation process and enabling more focused and personalized care.
</br> </br> Digitizing physical medical records will ensure the preservation of essential patient data, reducing the risk of loss or damage to paper documents. Standardizing the formatting of medical records will facilitate consultation and interpretation of information, promoting greater consistency in records.
</br> </br> The "epsy" system will be developed in compliance with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), ensuring that patients' sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access. This will bring greater security and reliability in data handling, reinforcing the confidence of patients and professionals in using the system.
</br> </br> The training offered to clinic professionals will ensure that they are able to use the new system efficiently and safely. This will not only facilitate the transition from using physical to digital records, but also promote a culture of conscious use of technology in the clinical environment.
</br> </br> Validation of the system with clinic professionals, with adjustments based on feedback received, should result in a high level of user satisfaction. The system is expected to fully meet the needs of professionals, contributing to the continuous improvement of services provided at the School Clinic.
</br> </br> By facilitating access and management of clinical information, the "epsy" system will contribute to more effective patient monitoring, potentially improving the results of the treatments offered. Thus, the project will have a positive impact on promoting the health and well-being of patients served by the clinic, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 3.

 ## Final Considerations (expected):

<p align="justify">
One of the main lessons learned from this project was the importance of integration and continuous communication between different professionals and disciplines. Working with the Psychology and Nutrition School Clinic team highlighted the need to understand the nuances of clinical processes and translate these needs into clear and viable technical requirements. I learned that constant dialogue with stakeholders is essential to ensure that the developed system meets the expectations and practical requirements of end users.
</br> </br> During the execution of the project, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the system was in full compliance with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD). This required a careful analysis of security and privacy requirements, as well as the implementation of robust measures to protect patient data. This process provided in-depth learning about data protection legislation and the importance of its practical application in information systems, especially in sensitive contexts such as healthcare.
</br> </br> The development and fulfillment of the activity schedule were crucial aspects for the success of the project. During execution, it was necessary to deal with unforeseen events, such as adjustments to the project scope and user feedback, which required flexibility and adaptations to the initial planning. This challenge highlighted the importance of effective time and resource management, as well as the ability to adapt in systems development projects. I learned to balance the need to meet deadlines with the need to deliver a high quality product.
